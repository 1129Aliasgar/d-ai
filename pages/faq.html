                                          <p><strong>Can children or minors use Grok?</strong></p>
                                          <p>Grok is not meant to be used by children or minors under the age of 18.
                                                While we have taken measures to limit undesirable training data and
                                                outputs, Grok could produce output that is not appropriate for all ages.

                                          <p><strong>How does Grok work?</strong></p>
                                          <p>Grok works by using advanced algorithms to understand and respond to your
                                                prompts. When you submit a prompt or search query, Grok interprets your
                                                words and other inputs based on natural language processing and patterns
                                                from its training data.</p>
                                          <p>Grok has a unique feature that allows it to search public X posts and
                                                perform real-time web searches, allowing it to respond with up-to-date
                                                information and insights on a wide range of topics. You can also choose
                                                between &quot;regular&quot; and &quot;fun&quot; modes for different
                                                conversational styles. Plus, you can help improve Grok by rating its
                                                responses.</p>

                                          <p><strong>How has Grok been pre-trained?</strong></p>
                                          <p>Grok has primarily been pre-trained on a large corpus of publicly available
                                                information, including raw web page data, metadata extracts, and text
                                                extracts from the Internet. This data helps Grok learn about
                                                associations between words and updates its numbers and weights to
                                                support natural language processing. In other words, the training data
                                                helps Grok learn about language and how to understand queries and
                                                respond to them in ways that humans can comprehend. Importantly, this
                                                training does not involve storing the data itself but rather refining
                                                the model&#x27;s internal language structures.</p>
                                          <p>Before using the training data, we apply quality filters and remove
                                                information that we do not want our models to learn from, such as
                                                violent content. We also apply security testing and evaluation measures.
                                                While Grok&#x27;s training data may include personal information that is
                                                publicly available (for example, information about politicians,
                                                celebrities or other public figures), xAI takes steps to minimize the
                                                processing of personal and sensitive data for training purposes. For
                                                clarity, we do not actively seek out personal information to train our
                                                models or use personal information to build individual profiles.</p>
                                          <p>More information about Grokâ€™s training journey is available on our <a
                                                      href="/model-card/">website</a>.</p>

                                          <p><strong>Does Grok make mistakes?</strong></p>
                                          <p>Grok may provide inaccurate or inappropriate information. Since Grok has
                                                been trained on publicly available information, it can confidently
                                                provide misleading or factually incorrect information. It may also
                                                reflect positive or negative views of politicians, celebrities, and
                                                other public figures. You should carefully consider and verify
                                                Grok&#x27;s responses.</p>

                                                responses to train our models. Specifically, this information helps our
