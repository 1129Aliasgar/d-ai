                                    <p>At xAI, we want to create AI tools that assist humanity in its quest for
                                          understanding and knowledge.</p>
                                    <p>By creating and improving Grok, we aim to:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                          <li>Gather feedback and ensure we are building AI tools that maximally benefit
                                                all of humanity. We believe that it is important to design AI tools that
                                                are useful to people of all backgrounds and political views. We also
                                                want empower our users with our AI tools, subject to the law. Our goal
                                                with Grok is to explore and demonstrate this approach in public.</li>
                                          <li>Empower research and innovation: We want Grok to serve as a powerful
                                                research assistant for anyone, helping them to quickly access relevant
                                                information, process data, and come up with new ideas.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Our ultimate goal is for our AI tools to assist in the pursuit of understanding.

                                    <h2 id="the-journey-to-grok-1">The journey to Grok-1</h2>
                                    <p>The engine powering Grok is Grok-1, our frontier LLM, which we developed over the
                                          last four months. Grok-1 has gone through many iterations over this span of
                                          time.</p>
                                    <p>After announcing xAI, we trained a prototype LLM (Grok-0) with 33 billion
                                          parameters. This early model approaches LLaMA 2 (70B) capabilities on standard

                                          months, we have made significant improvements in reasoning and coding
                                          capabilities leading up to Grok-1, a state-of-the-art language model that is
                                          significantly more powerful, achieving 63.2% on the HumanEval coding task and
                                          73% on MMLU.</p>

                                          designed to measure math and reasoning abilities.</p>

                                    <p>At the frontier of deep learning research, reliable infrastructure must be built
                                          with the same care as datasets and learning algorithms. To create Grok, we
                                          built a custom training and inference stack based on Kubernetes, Rust, and
                                          JAX.</p>
                                    <p>LLM training runs like a freight train thundering ahead; if one car derails, the
                                          entire train is dragged off the tracks, making it difficult to set upright
                                          again. There are a myriad of ways GPUs fail: manufacturing defects, loose
                                          connections, incorrect configuration, degraded memory chips, the occasional
                                          random bit flip, and more. When training, we synchronize computations across
                                          tens of thousands of GPUs for months on end, and all these failure modes
                                          become frequent due to scale. To overcome these challenges, we employ a set of
                                          custom distributed systems that ensure that every type of failure is
                                          immediately identified and automatically handled. At xAI, we have made
                                          maximizing useful compute per watt the key focus of our efforts. Over the past
                                          few months, our infrastructure has enabled us to minimize downtime and
                                          maintain a high Model Flop Utilization (MFU) even in the presence of
                                          unreliable hardware.</p>
                                    <p>Rust has proven to be an ideal choice for building scalable, reliable, and
                                          maintainable infrastructure. It offers high performance, a rich ecosystem, and
                                          prevents the majority of bugs one would typically find in a distributed
                                          system. Given our small team size, infrastructure reliability is crucial,
                                          otherwise, maintenance starves innovation. Rust provides us with confidence
                                          that any code modification or refactor is likely to produce working programs
                                          that will run for months with minimal supervision.</p>
                                    <p>We are now preparing for our next jump in model capabilities, which will require
                                          reliably coordinating training runs on tens of thousands of accelerators,

                                    <p>We give Grok access to search tools and real-time information, but as with all
                                          the LLMs trained on next-token prediction, our model can still generate false
                                          or contradictory information. We believe that achieving reliable reasoning is
                                          the most important research direction to address the limitations of current
                                          systems. Here, we would like to highlight a few promising research directions
                                          we are most excited about at xAI:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                          <li><strong>Scalable oversight with tool assistance.</strong> Human feedback
                                                is essential. However, providing consistent and accurate feedback can be
                                                challenging, especially when dealing with lengthy code or complex
                                                reasoning steps. AI can assist with scalable oversight by looking up
                                                references from different sources, verifying intermediate steps with
                                                external tools, and seeking human feedback when necessary. We aim to
                                                make the most effective use of our <a

                                                      tutors&#x27;</a> time with the help of our models.</li>
                                          <li><strong>Integrating with formal verification for safety, reliability, and
                                                      grounding.</strong> To create AI systems that can reason deeply
                                                about the real world, we plan to develop reasoning skills in less
                                                ambiguous and more verifiable situations. This allows us to evaluate our
                                                systems without human feedback or interaction with the real world. One
                                                major immediate goal of this approach is to give formal guarantees for
                                                code correctness, especially regarding formally verifiable aspects of AI
                                                safety.</li>
                                          <li><strong>Long-context understanding and retrieval.</strong> Training models
                                                for efficiently discovering useful knowledge in a particular context are
                                                at the heart of producing truly intelligent systems. We are working on
                                                methods that can discover and retrieve information whenever it is
                                                needed.</li>
                                          <li><strong>Adversarial robustness.</strong> Adversarial examples demonstrate
                                                that optimizers can easily exploit vulnerabilities in AI systems, both
                                                during training and serving time, causing them to make egregious
                                                mistakes. These vulnerabilities are long-standing weaknesses of deep
                                                learning models. We are particularly interested in improving the
                                                robustness of LLMs, reward models, and monitoring systems.</li>
                                          <li><strong>Multimodal capabilities.</strong> Currently, Grok doesn‚Äôt have
                                                other senses, such as vision and audio. To better assist users, we will
                                                equip Grok with these different senses that can enable broader
                                                applications, including real-time interactions and assistance.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>We believe that AI holds immense potential for contributing significant
                                          scientific and economic value to society, so we will work towards developing
                                          reliable safeguards against catastrophic forms of malicious use. We believe in
                                          doing our utmost to ensure that AI remains a force for good.</p>
